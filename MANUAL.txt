  CG Workbench
================

The CG Workbench is a live multimedia environment which allows rapid prototyping of
graphic effects or multimedia applications.

  Usage
---------

This is just a rough description on how the workbench should be used:

The workbench is based on the concept of connect nodes. Each node has inputs and outputs.
Inputs affect how the node processes its data, outputs are the result of processing.

Nodes can be connected by dragging an output (on the right side of a node) to a
input (on the left side of a node). Compatible inputs will be highlighted when a
drag is in process. Removing a link is done by clicking a connected input of the node.

Here are some nodes to get a quick start:

- "Image"
  Provides a texture that can be used in shaders.
- "Shader"
  Provides a shader where you can define uniforms which are available as node inputs.
- "Renderer"
  Will render a flat quad with the connected shader. When geometry is connected,
  will render the geometry instead.
- "Float", "Vec2", "Vec3", â€¦
  Are nodes that provide raw values which can be combined with arithmetic nodes
  or can be passed into shaders.

Right now, there is no full description of node types available. Most nodes are kinda
self explanatory, and most can be understood by just playing around. Don't be shy,
the workbench is there for experimentation!

  Hotkeys
-----------

The hotkey scheme is hardcoded at the moment. These are the available actions:

| Input                                | Action                                           |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl+Space, Rightclick on Background | Open *New Node* window                           |
| Right-Click on a node                | Open node editor (save to template, rename node) |
| Ctrl + Left Mouse + Drag             | Drag viewport window                             |
| Ctrl + R                             | Recompile current window                         |
| Ctrl + S                             | Save                                             |
| Ctrl + Shift + S                     | Save As                                          |
| Ctrl + N                             | New document                                     |
| Ctrl + O                             | Open File                                        |
| Alt + F4                             | Exit                                             |

  Templates
-------------

The CG Workbench searches templates in the folder `templates` next to the executable. Save your
own node types in the directory structure there and you can quickly create them by using
the create menu and selecting the templates there.

  Updates
-----------

This program is open source and is developed on GitHub:

Check out the GitHub page for new public releases!

  Bugs
--------

The program is not very well tested at the moment. If you find a bug, please create
a GitHub Issue or report the bug to:

  cg-workbench@mq32.de

It would be nice to have a project file that produces the crash or have a description
on how to reproduce it.
